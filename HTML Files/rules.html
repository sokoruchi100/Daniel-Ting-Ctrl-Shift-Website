                            and your opponent's hand will be revealed. Your hand is on the left of the conclusion and the opponent's
                            hand is on the right in color. The color is determined by which skill level you are currently on. For
                            example, if it says "Rock Beats Scissors", you had Rock and the opponent had Scissors. To determine who won,
                            simply remember this: Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.</p>

                        <p class="level text">The game is split into three skill levels: Beginner, Experienced, and Champion. As the
                            levels progress, the timer gets reduced and the opponent's patterns increase in complexity and randomness.
                            You can tell which difficulty you are currently on by the color of the number on the right of the "POINTS"
                            tab. Green means beginner, yellow means experienced, and red means champion.</p>

                            number is 15 on beginner, 10 on experienced, and 5 on champion. You will have less time as the skill level
                            increases, so think quickly. If you run out of time, you will automatically lose the round, so make sure you
                            play a hand.</p>

                        <p class="winning text">When you beat the opponent in one round, you gain a point which is shown on the left of
                            the "POINTS" tab. If you lose, the opponent gains a point. If you both tie, no one gains a point. In order
                            to win, you must earn 3 points in one game. If the opponent earns 3 points, you lose. Once you lose, you can
                            play again to try to win. If you won the game, you can continue to the higher skill level. Try to beat the
                            game without a single loss.</p>

                        <p class="patterns text">The opponents, although appearing random at first, hold many intricate patterns in
                            their decisions. These patterns were based on real life players and their own subconcious patterns. Let's
                            take a look at the beginner level for example. Here, the opponent has a pretty basic pattern. If the
                            opponent wins a round, it will stick with that hand for the next round. For example, if the opponent wins
                            with rock, it will play rock on the next round. If the opponent loses the round, it will move on to the next
                            hand in the rock-paper-scissors fashion. For example, if the opponent plays rock and loses, it will then
                            play paper.</p>

                        <h2 class="predictions title">Predicting Your Opponent</h2>
                        <p class="predictions text">With this key information, you can thus predict what your opponent is going to
                            throw. If your opponent won the last round with scissors, what should you throw for this round? If your
                            answer was rock, then you are correct! Because the opponent is inclined to throw the same winning hand
                            again, you should take advantage of that weakness and throw the hand that will beat your opponent's. More
                            experienced players know this as well, so they will also try to predict your moves as well.</p>

                        <p class="statistics text">You would think that there is 1/3 chance of throwing either rock, paper, or scissors,
                            but that wouldn't be exactly the case. Studies have reported that rock and scissors actually have a higher
                            chance of being thrown than paper.(Rock 35%, Scissors 35%, Paper 30%). When you encounter a tie, it might be
                            best to go for paper or rock.</p>

                        <p class="first text">Most people choose rock as their first move since it is the easiest to throw. More
                            experienced players know this fact, which is why they are more likely to throw paper. Those who are fighting
                            against seasoned players might even go for scissors to beat those who first throw paper.</p>
