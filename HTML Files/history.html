                <p class="tabStuff">The first known mention of this game was from the Ming Dynasty book, Wuzazu, but the book stated that the game further dates back to the Han Dynasty, around 200 BC. The game was originally called Shoushiling, meaning “the three who are afraid of each other.” Although quite primeval, it had all of the rules that modern Janken has. The game was very popular among the peasantry since it required only their hands to play it. Eventually, it became popular enough to transcend nations.</p>

                <h2 class="tabHeading">Arrival to Japan</h2>
                <p>In the 17th Century, this Chinese game was imported to Japan where it became its own genre of hand(ken) games called Sansukumi-Ken. The first Sansukumi-Ken game was called mushi-ken and it used the frog, slug, and snake hand signs instead of the modern rock, paper, and scissors. In mushi-ken the frog (thumb) beats the slug (pinky finger) which beats the snake (index finger) which, in turn, beats the frog. The most popular sansukumi-ken game in Japan was kitsune-ken. In this version, a supernatural fox called a kitsune defeats the village head, the village head defeats the hunter, and the hunter defeats the fox. And unlike mushi-ken, Kitsune-ken is played with both hands.</p>

                <h2 class="tabHeading">Spreading Across the World</h2>
                <p>In the turn of the 20th century, most sansukumi-ken games had died in obscurity except for Janken, which is currently recognized as the standard worldwide version. Japan's increasing influence and the spread of Japanese immigrants also increased the recognition of Janken. In the 1920s, many Western articles explained the rules of the game and even claimed that the game hailed from Europe. Eventually, it became so popular that it is now seen as an average occurance in daily life. It's not known as to why Janken succeeded in gaining popularity, but many speculate that it was because of the easy to use handsigns that a global audience could recognize.</p>

                <p> Although it has origins dating back to China, the game is steeped in Japanese Culture. The game, although trivial in its original purpose, was used to settle many major debates. One famous story involved settling a Florida court case while another was to settle Takashi Hashiyama's painting auction. There are even Worldwide Rock Paper Scissors tournaments held by the World Rock Paper Scissors Association (WRPSA). Some say that the Comte de Rochambeau, the famous frenchman who fought alongside the American revolutionaries, played this game (which is why some call it Roshambo) but there is little evidence to support it. </p>
